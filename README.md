# Ca1

Basic extension that replaces any mention of UC Berkeley with a more accurate description of the university.

Replaces:
- University of California, Berkeley
- UC Berkeley
- Berkeley
- Cal

With "The Number One Public University in the World"

The extension will run every time you travel to a new page or click the browser action. However, if you simply run some javascript on a page (such as searching on Google without refreshing or clicking a button that performs an action) that reveals new mentions of UC Berkeley, the extension will not detect those changes.
